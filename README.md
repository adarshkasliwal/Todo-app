- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or not completed with a simple checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are saved in the local storage of the browser, ensuring they remain available even after refreshing or closing the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used for app development.
